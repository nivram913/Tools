## exploit_REDACTED.py

A tool to ease the exploitation of an XSS on REDACTED with mitmproxy.

## signal-wrapper.sh

A script to wrap Signal desktop application to increase I/O performance with tmpfs (in-RAM disk).

## rt_allow_aa.sh

A script to monitor and notify the user about AppArmor policy violation when Firefox tries to read a file in home folder. Then the user can allow the access to the file by creating a hard link to the file into an allowed folder by the Firefox AppArmor policy.
